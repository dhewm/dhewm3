GENERAL NOTES
=============

Game data and patching:
-----------------------

This source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still
covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

You must patch the game to the latest version.

Note that Doom 3 and Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil are available from the Steam store at
http://store.steampowered.com/app/9050/
http://store.steampowered.com/app/9070/

Compiling
---------

The build system is based on CMake: http://cmake.org/

Required libraries are not part of the tree. These are:
- libjpeg (minimum v6, v8 recommended)
- libogg
- libvorbis
- libvorbisfile (may be part of libvorbis)
- OpenAL (OpenAL Soft recommended, Creative's and Apple's versions are made of fail)
- SDL v1.2
- libcurl (optional, required for server downloads)

For UNIX like system these libraries need to be installed (including the
developer files). It is recommended to use the software management tools of
your OS (apt-get, portage, rpm, BSD ports, MacPorts, ...).

For Windows there are two options:
1) Use the provided binaries (recommended, see below)
2) Compile these libraries yourself

Create a distinct build folder outside of this source repository and issue
the cmake command there, pointing it at the neo/ folder from this repository:
cmake /path/to/repository/neo

Using the provided Windows binaries:
------------------------------------
Get a clone of the latest binaries here: https://github.com/dhewg/doom3-libs

There are two subfolder:
- 32bit binaries are located in "i686-w64-mingw32"
- 64bit binaries are located in "x86_64-w64-mingw32"

Issue the appropriate command from the build folder, for example:

cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" -DDOOM3LIBS=/path/to/doom3-libs/i686-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo
cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" -DDOOM3LIBS=/path/to/doom3-libs/x86_64-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo

The binaries are compatible with mingw-w64 and all MSVC versions.

Cross compiling:
----------------

For cross compiling a CMake Toolchain file is required.
For the mingw-w64 toolchain "i686-w64-mingw32" on Ubuntu precise it looks like:

< --- cut --- >
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR i686)

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-g++)
set(CMAKE_RC_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-windres)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH /usr/i686-w64-mingw32)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
< --- cut --- >

Then point CMake at your Toolchain file:
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/Toolchain.cmake -DDOOM3LIBS=/path/to/doom3-libs/i686-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo

Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows:
--------------------------------------

The Doom 3 GPL source code release does not include functionality enabling rendering
of stencil shadows via the “depth fail” method, a functionality commonly known as
"Carmack's Reverse".

MayaImport:
---------------------------

The code for our Maya export plugin is included, if you are a Maya licensee
you can obtain the SDK from Autodesk.
