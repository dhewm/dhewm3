Brief description of each mod the source codes are for:

The DOOM 3: HardQore modification brings classic, fast paced, thumb blistering side scrolling action to Hell. Forget long winded plots, or boring puzzles, this is 110% non stop in your face run n' gun slaughter. Strap on advanced UAC weaponry and take on the Forces of hell. If your a fan of classic action games such as Contra & Metal Slug; then HardQore is what you have been waiting for.

Ruiner is a dark, nightmarish, third person action modification for Doom3. The player assumes the role of a herald of Death & fights hordes of the damned using unique weapons, abilities and spells.
