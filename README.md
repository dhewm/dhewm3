# ABOUT

_dhewm 3_ is a _Doom 3_ GPL source port, known to work on at least Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD.

The goal of _dhewm 3_ is bring _DOOM 3_ with the help of SDL to all suitable
platforms.

Bugs present in the original _DOOM 3_ will be fixed (when identified) without
altering the original gameplay.

# CHANGES

Compared to the original _DOOM 3_, the changes of _dhewm 3_ worth mentioning are:

- 64-bit port
- SDL for low-level OS support, OpenGL and input handling
- OpenAL for audio output, all OS-specific audio backends are gone
- OpenAL EFX for EAX reverb effects (read: EAX-like sound effects on all platforms/hardware)
- Better support for widescreen (and arbitrary display resolutions)
- A portable build system based on CMake
- (Cross-)compilation with MinGW-w64


# GENERAL NOTES

## Game data and patching

This source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still
covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

You must patch the game to the latest version (1.3.1). See the FAQ for details, including
how to get the game data from Steam on Linux or OSX.

Note that _Doom 3_ and _Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil_ are available from the Steam Store at

http://store.steampowered.com/app/9050/

http://store.steampowered.com/app/9070/

You can also buy Steam keys at the Humble Store:

https://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/doom3_storefront

https://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/doom3_resofevil_storefront

Note that neither Steam nor the Humble Store offer the *Resurrection of Evil* addon
for German customers (or at least people with German IP adresses).

## Compiling

The build system is based on CMake: http://cmake.org/

Required libraries are not part of the tree. These are:

- zlib
- libjpeg (v8)
- libogg
- libvorbis
- libvorbisfile (may be part of libvorbis)
- OpenAL (OpenAL Soft required, Creative's and Apple's versions are made of fail)
- SDL v1.2 or 2.0 (2.0 recommended)
- libcurl (optional, required for server downloads)

For UNIX-like systems, these libraries need to be installed (including the
developer files). It is recommended to use the software management tools of
your OS (apt, dnf, portage, BSD ports, [Homebrew for macOS](http://brew.sh), ...).

For Windows, there are two options:

- Use the provided binaries (recommended, see below)
- Compile these libraries yourself

Create a distinct build folder outside of this source repository and issue
the cmake command there, pointing it at the neo/ folder from this repository:

`cmake /path/to/repository/neo`

macOS users need to point CMake at OpenAL Soft (better solutions welcome):

`cmake -DOPENAL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/openal-soft/lib/libopenal.dylib -DOPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openal-soft/include /path/to/repository/neo`

### Mods

See https://github.com/DanielGibson/dhewm3-mods for instructions on how to build
some mods that provide source und GPL and how to port other mods to _dhewm3_.

Basically, you have to clone aforementioned repository to `dhewm3/neo/mods`
and run cmake with `-DMODS=ON`

## Using the provided Windows binaries

Get a clone of the latest binaries here: https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3-libs

There are two subfolders:

- 32-bit binaries are located in `i686-w64-mingw32`
- 64-bit binaries are located in `x86_64-w64-mingw32`

Issue the appropriate command from the build folder, for example:

`cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" -DDHEWM3LIBS=/path/to/dhewm3-libs/i686-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo`

`cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DDHEWM3LIBS=/path/to/dhewm3-libs/x86_64-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo`

The binaries are compatible with MinGW-w64 and all MSVC versions.

## Cross-compiling

For cross-compiling, a CMake Toolchain file is required.

For the MinGW-w64 toolchain `i686-w64-mingw32` on Ubuntu 12.04, it looks like:

```
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR i686)

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-g++)
set(CMAKE_RC_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-windres)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH /usr/i686-w64-mingw32)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
```

Then point CMake at your toolchain file:
`cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/Toolchain.cmake -DDHEWM3LIBS=/path/to/dhewm3-libs/i686-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo`

## Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows

The Doom 3 GPL source code release does not include functionality enabling rendering
of stencil shadows via the "depth fail" method, a functionality commonly known as
"Carmack's Reverse".

***Note*** that this **does *not* change the visual appereance** of the game.
The shadows look the same, they're just created in a slightly different way.
In theory there might be a small performance impact, but on hardware less than
ten years old it shouldn't make a difference.

## MayaImport

The code for our Maya export plugin is included, if you are a Maya licensee
you can obtain the SDK from Autodesk.
